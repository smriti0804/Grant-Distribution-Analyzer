# üîß **Key Fixes Applied to Resolve Duplicate Counting Issue**

## **Problem Identified:**
Your addresses were only being counted once even when they received tokens multiple times because of incorrect unique transaction key logic.

## **Root Cause:**
The unique transaction identifier was using `(timestamp, txHash, value)` which prevented the same beneficiary from receiving the same amount multiple times.

## **Key Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **‚úÖ Fixed Unique Transaction Key Logic**
**Before (WRONG):**
```python
# Line ~365 in your original code:
unique_tx_key = (timestamp_str, txh_db, value_str)  # ‚ùå Includes value
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```python
# Line ~365 in fixed code:
unique_tx_key = (timestamp_str, txh_db)  # ‚úÖ Excludes value to allow same amounts
```

### 2. **‚úÖ Enhanced Debug Output**
Added better debugging to track transaction processing:
```python
if DEBUG:
    print(f"[DEBUG] Added {raw_amt} (scaled: {scaled_amt}) for beneficiary {rec_addr} from unique tx {unique_tx_key}")
    print(f"[DEBUG] Current total for {rec_addr}: {beneficiaries[rec_addr]}")
```

### 3. **‚úÖ Added Top 10 Beneficiaries Summary**
```python
# DEBUG: Show top 10 beneficiaries by amount
if DEBUG and beneficiaries:
    print(f"\n[DEBUG] Top 10 beneficiaries by amount:")
    sorted_beneficiaries = sorted(beneficiaries.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    for i, (addr, amount) in enumerate(sorted_beneficiaries[:10]):
        print(f"  {i+1}. {addr}: {amount}")
```

## **What This Fixes:**

### **Before Fix:**
- If address `0x123` received 1000 ARB twice, only the first transaction was counted
- Total would show: 1000 ARB ‚ùå

### **After Fix:**
- If address `0x123` received 1000 ARB twice, both transactions are counted
- Total will show: 2000 ARB ‚úÖ

## **How to Use the Fixed Version:**

1. **Replace your current script** with `scripts/protocol_analyzer_fixed.py`
2. **Run the analysis** for your address `0x98237513fcB956f63D52074D507970E8Fc4D5e82`
3. **Check the debug output** to see:
   - How many unique transactions each beneficiary has
   - Current running totals for each beneficiary
   - Top 10 beneficiaries by amount

## **Expected Results:**
- Beneficiaries who received tokens multiple times will now show the correct cumulative amounts
- The CSV output will reflect the true total amounts received by each address
- Debug output will help you verify that transactions are being counted correctly

## **About Merkl Data:**
You mentioned that Merkl data doesn't have transaction hashes - this is correct. The Merkl API provides campaign data but not individual transaction hashes for each distribution. This is normal and expected behavior.

The fix primarily addresses the Disperse contract tracing logic where transaction hashes are available and should be used to prevent duplicate counting while allowing multiple transactions with the same amount.
